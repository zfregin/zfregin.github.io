### Personal Webpage
***

#### Objective

Upon completion of the HTML and CSS course this project was to create a personal webpage with which I could demonstrate my programming skills, link to an online portfolio, provide contact information, and tell a little bit about myself.

#### Steps Taken

When starting out I first had to decide what content I wanted to include and the type of layout I wanted to display it with. During the course I had done some work with the Bootstrap framework and really liked its clean appearance so I decided to use it for the webpage layout. Bootstrap is also a very popular library for front-end development. I landed on a simple layout using the Bootstrap card containers to display all the content. Finally satisfied after a bunch of tinkering and tweaking, I set it up for hosting on GitHub. You can find it [here](https://zfregin.github.io/).

#### The Result

A successful initial design of my personal webpage! It was pretty exciting to be able to link someone to my live page. During the process I experienced what would be the first of many sessions spent poring over framework documentation and Stack Overflow looking for solutions. I had developed a vision for the layout and I was determined to achieve it, but certain components were not playing nicely in the beginning. It took an unexpected amount of tinkering with content overlays and alignment until I finally had everything neatly in its envisioned place. I was satisfied with this initial version but I do expect to come back to revamp the webpage later on with additional content and new projects.
